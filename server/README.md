## Weekend Calendar Server

### Installing

Use `npm install` to install the server dependencies.

### Starting

Use `npm start` to boot the server. Since it uses an in-memory instance of MongoDB, wait a few minutes while it downloads the MongoDB server before using the server.

### In-memory database

This server is using an in-memory MongoDB instance to ease the application instalation via Mockgoose. All data stored is lost once the server is taken down.
